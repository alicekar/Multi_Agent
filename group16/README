
This project aims at solving a special case of the Vehicle Routing Problemm with Ant Optimization Colony, implemented in Python 3.4. 

We simulate three diffrent enviroments in respective python file,
	MMTSP.py - Multiple-Depot Multiple Travelling Salesmen Problem
		A simplified enviroment where we only look to minimize the routes of multiple couriers.
	MultiUber.py - Multiple-Depot Multiple Travelling Salesmen Problem with Pick-up and delivery
		Extended version to fit our problem with pickup and delivery of food at resurants and customers
	Uber_dynamic_enviroment - Non-deterministic Multiple-Depot Multiple Travelling Salesmen Problem with Pick-up and delivery
		A further extention where new orders may pop up during the simulation and replanning occurs. 

Two data structures are used, Ant and Car to symbolize the ants in the ACO algorithm and cars when the dynamic enviroment. 

All files are executable with calling the main function or by simply running the file. Variables are either changed in the file, or sent in as parameters to the main function.
