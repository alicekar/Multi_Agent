Programming exercises and Multi-Agent Project. The specific tasks for the problems are stated in problems.pdf and
the solutions are found in map 080.

The project is a special case of the vehicle routing problem and we wish to find an optimal way to distribute food deliveries between couriers for a food delivering company. The solution was developed with the "Multiple Salesmen problem" in mind, and we used an ant colony optimization algorithm.
